Descrption about the dockeryaml file 

This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a setup with two services:

1. **Python App (myapp)**:
   - Uses the `python:0.1` image (consider updating to a valid version).
   - Depends on `mysql` to start first.
   - Builds from the local `Dockerfile`.
   - Sets environment variables for connecting to MySQL (host, port, user, password, database).
   - Connects to the `jhc` network.

2. **MySQL Database (mysql)**:
   - Uses the latest MySQL image.
   - Exposes port `3306` to the host.
   - Initializes with a root password, database name, user, and password.
   - Also connects to the `jhc` network.

3. **Network**:
   - **jhc**: Custom bridge network enabling internal communication between containers.
